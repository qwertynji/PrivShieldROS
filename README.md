## What is PrivShieldROS
PrivShieldROS is a private data storage system for high privacy protection of sensitive data in robotics applications. The system uses three main technologies: blockchain, IPFS, and HybridABEnc. PrivShieldROS provides a user-friendly framework for secure storage and reliable sharing of private data.

PrivShieldROS uses blockchain technology to ensure data immutability, decentralized management, resistance to tampering, transparency and traceability. Based on IPFS technology, the system also provides excellent storage stability and efficient data retrieval capability. In addition, by introducing the HybridABEnc solution, PrivShieldROS takes privacy to the next level by supporting attribute-based fine-grained access control, allowing the system to dynamically manage access to data based on a user's role, task, or other attributes.

This system is designed to provide a safe, reliable, efficient and highly privacy-protected solution for sensitive information storage and sharing in the robot operating system (ROS) environment. By combining these technologies, it aims to protect highly sensitive private data, including its secure storage, reliable sharing and privacy protection.

## How to use

#### Step 1 : Prepare related environment configurations
The HybridABEnc solution in PrivShieldROS relies on the Charme-Crypto library and ensures that your Python environment configuration includes both Python 3.7 and Python 3.10 versions. At the same time, the related configuration of blockchain and IPFS can be set according to the characteristics of your system. In addition, you will need to install and configure the Redis database. As for redis Settings, please refer to [the] (https://redis.io/download).

#### Step 2 : Registration
To register the identity, please run the following codes:

```
cd $PrivShieldROS
python register.py
```

And follow the instructions.

#### Step 3 : Start monitoring and data processing

Run the following code to initialize the variable:

```
cd $PrivShieldROS
python general_control_official.py
```

When you enter the folder path and topic type, the system will automatically enable the monitoring of related topics. However, before you start monitoring, make sure that the 'redis' module and your ROS topic publishing node are functioning properly.
